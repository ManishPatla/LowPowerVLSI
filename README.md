# LowPowerVLSI

## Design of Low Power TSPC CMOS D Flip Flop using SVL method:

## Introduction

This project focuses on the design and analysis of a Low Power TSPC CMOS D Flip-Flop using Supply Voltage Level (SVL) Methods.
The primary goal is to reduce power consumption, especially due to leakage currents, and optimize battery backup time while the circuit is in standby mode.

### Motivation

- **Power Consumption**: In CMOS technology, power dissipation is a significant concern, especially due to leakage currents. This project aims to minimize power consumption.

- **Battery Backup**: Reducing power consumption during standby mode is crucial for extending the time available for battery backup.

### Key Objectives

- Design an efficient D Flip-Flop circuit.
- Implement supply voltage level (SVL) methods to reduce power consumption.
- Minimize power consumption and leakage currents through the use of a minimal number of transistors.
- Enable the D Flip-Flop for applications like binary counters, shift registers, and analog and digital circuit systems.

### Technology

The project leverages CMOS technology, with a specific focus on mitigating leakage power to enhance energy efficiency and extend battery backup time.
